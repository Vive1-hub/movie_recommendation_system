**🎬 Movie Recommendation System**

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using Python.
It recommends movies similar to a given movie based on features such as genre, keywords, and description.

**📌 Project Overview**

Recommendation systems are widely used by platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and IMDb to suggest relevant content to users.
In this project, a content-based filtering approach is used to recommend movies by computing similarity between movie features.

**🧠 Approach Used**

Content-Based Filtering

Text vectorization of movie features

Similarity computation using Cosine Similarity

The system recommends movies that are most similar in content to the selected movie.

**🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used**

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical computations

Scikit-learn – vectorization & similarity calculation

Jupyter Notebook – development environment

**📊 Dataset**

movies.csv

Contains movie-related information such as:

Movie title , Genres , Overview / description , Other relevant metadata

**Output**

Given a movie name as input, the system outputs a list of recommended movies that are most similar in content.
